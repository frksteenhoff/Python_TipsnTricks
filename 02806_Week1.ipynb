    "  * JSON, or **JavaScript Object Notation** is a standard format for transmitting data in a format which is human readable. \n",
    "  * As of now, it is used most commonly for server/browser communication. \n",
    "  * JSON is language independent and derived from [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) \n",
    "  * **Bonus**\n",
    "    * File extension **.json**\n",
    "    * Largely replacing XML\n",
    "    * There are some portability issues JSON/JavaScript, but browsers are starting to support JSON and have native encoding and decoding\n",
    "* Why is `json` superior to `xml`? (... or why not?)\n",
    "Using [this slightly biased source](http://www.json.org/xml.html) the following can be said in the XML/JSON debate:\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the excitement around XML is around a new role as an interchangeable data serialization format. XML provides two enormous advantages as a data representation language:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * It is text-based.\n",
    "  * It is position-independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "*But XML is not well-suited for data-interchange and does not match the data model for a lot of programming languages*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simplicity** - XML is simpler than SGML, but JSON is much simpler than XML. JSON has a much smaller grammar and maps more directly onto the data structures used in modern programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Extensibility** - JSON is not extensible because it does not need to be. JSON is not a document markup language, so it is not necessary to define new tags or attributes to represent data in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interoperability** - JSON has the same interoperability potential as XML.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Openness** -JSON is at least as open as XML, perhaps more so because it is not in the center of corporate/political standardization struggles.\n",
